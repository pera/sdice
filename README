A simple diceware implementation for Unix-like systems based on a slightly modified version of EFF's Short Wordlist #1 (https://www.eff.org/dice): this dictionary contains 1024 words between 4 and 5 characters, providing exactly 10 bits of entropy per word.

The default optimization level of GCC should produce the expected binary.

Please always review the code and the assembler output of your compiler, and most important, do not use this program if you don't understand its possible attack vectors; using a real dice is usually safer :)
